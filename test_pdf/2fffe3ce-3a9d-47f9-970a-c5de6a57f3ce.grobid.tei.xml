<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Several organizations and commentators have posited that China's hydrogen and electrolysis industry could follow the path of solar PV, which experienced rapid cost reductions and led to China dominating the field. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> However, this paper argues that this analogy is overly simplistic and may not play out in the field of PEM electrolyzers due to multiple factors.</p><p>To start with, the domestic policy environment for hydrogen today differs from that for solar PV in the mid-2000s. Solar PV and renewable hydrogen are both viewed by China as areas with high potential for industrial upgrading and both benefit from state support, particularly at the provincial level. However, they have been developed with a different outlook, with hydrogen slated for domestic value chains whereas solar PV products were initially designed for export. Moreover, a favourable policy environment is only one element in the solar industry's success story, and the same is true for hydrogen. Other factors need to be considered, including technological attributes, corporate internationalization strategies, the global context for trade and innovation, and the availability and nature of direct government support.</p><p>Among the two competing electrolyzer technologies, China is catching up in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Meanwhile, China's manufacturing and export focus is on alkaline electrolyzers, where its advantage is likely to remain the most significant and where, similar to solar PV, government support has enabled sharp reductions in costs. With increasing experience in overseas energy investments, Chinese energy equipment manufacturers can export alkaline electrolyzers. But in the coming years, further cost declines in alkaline electrolyzers may be difficult to achieve because the learning rate for alkaline electrolyzers is likely to level off. Most of the cost reductions are estimated to be greatest in their current, initial, development period. Also, the complexity of PEM electrolyzers distinguishes their development from PV cells and modules. The complexity of electrolysis systems suggests that foreign investment in manufacturing may do little to promote innovation, especially in PEM electrolyzers, in contrast to solar PV development which benefitted much from the transfer of standardized manufacturing lines. In addition to uncertainties around the trajectories of cost reductions and China's ability to develop PEM electrolyzers, China's export potential will depend on various factors, including the supply-demand balance domestically and globally, as well as protectionist policies around the world.</p><p>The uncertainty around China's ability to replicate its success with solar may allay Western concerns that China will dominate global renewable hydrogen supply chains. It also suggests cost declines that would help accelerate deployment may also be more limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> Furthermore, China's decision-makers are focusing on domestic deployment rather than exports. All these factors point to a different growth trajectory for electrolysis, as compared with solar PV, at least over the next five years.</p><p>The aim of the paper is to highlight the similarities and differences between these two sectors, acknowledging, however, that they are at different levels of development: China's renewable hydrogen sector is still nascent compared with the more mature solar industry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3</ref> As such, this comparative analysis focuses on the early developmental phases of solar and renewable hydrogen. Specifically, the early stage of solar PV development primarily refers to the period from 1970 to 2004. The timeline for hydrogen electrolysis development is complex, tracing back to 1986 with a focus on fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). But the complexity of the hydrogen value chain and the uncertainty around its application (especially in transport where it struggled to compete with electric vehicles) hindered hydrogen technology development, leading to periods of growth and decline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref> Since 2016, as China's decarbonization strategy began to gain momentum, and the Chinese government has placed greater emphasis on the development of hydrogen value chains, including renewable hydrogen production and electrolyzers, the hydrogen industry has witnessed a renewed development push. Since 2020, the field has become more concerted and focused. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> Therefore, although the early development stages for hydrogen span a long period, from 1986 to now, this paper focuses on the period after 2016, particularly after 2020, because of the many new policies adopted and heightened government attention since then. This paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 summarize the historical development of solar PV and renewable hydrogen, while Section 4 compares their development trajectories. Section 5 delves deeper into government support and its role in boosting manufacturing of solar products and electrolysers. Section 6 looks beyond government policy and examines the technological characteristics of solar PV and electrolyzers and how these relate to their cost-reduction patterns. Section 7 examines the early stages of international cooperation on solar PV and renewable hydrogen, exploring how solar PV manufacturers and hydrogen companies have interacted with global supply chains in practice. This section also assesses the implications of a shifting global landscape for exporting electrolyzers. Building on these insights, Section 8 summarizes and highlights the implications of China's electrolyser development for its role in the supply chains of renewable hydrogen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Development of Solar PV in China: An export-oriented industry led by the private sector</head><p>The development of China's solar PV industry can be divided into four stages:</p><p>• The slow-development stage (1970-2004);</p><p>• The wild-growth stage (2004-2008);</p><p>• The high-speed-development stage (2009-2018); and</p><p>• The grid-parity stage (2019-present). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> In the first two stages, Chinese companies were active in the labour-intensive mid-stream (for example, cell production and PV module encapsulation). This was driven by the huge demand for solar PV products in Europe, enabled by technology transfer from industrialized countries (such as Germany, Australia, the US, and Canada) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7</ref> and by local government support. But Chinese companies were weak in the upstream sector, specifically in the manufacture of purified polycrystalline silicon which was dominated by foreign companies. Manufacturing solar cells was therefore costly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref> Starting in 2009, in the face of decreasing exports, anti-dumping investigations issued by the European Union (EU) and US, and the global financial crisis, the Chinese government began to help the solar PV industry shift from an export-oriented manufacturing industry to one fulfilling the domestic deployment of solar, and issued policies on market consolidation and technology advancement to foster the domestic solar market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Solar PV's initial phase featured start-ups and basic policy support for an emerging export product</head><p>The development of China's solar PV industry between 1970 and 2004 saw the emergence of first-wave start-ups supported by local governments to capture external demand for solar PV products, despite general central support for renewable energy. In 1997, the State Planning Commission (the former National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC) issued Interim Measures for Managing Basic Construction Projects for New Energy, an administrative regulation, aiming to accelerate the localization of manufacturing of new energy equipment including solar PV products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9</ref> This was the first time that the central government officially supported the solar PV manufacturing industry as part of broader efforts to develop renewable energy technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10</ref> In addition, the policy on 'Electrification in Western Villages and Towns' adopted by the State Planning Commission in 2002, helped electrify remote areas with solar, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> as solar PV was increasingly seen as a way to increase electricity supply. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12</ref> The early development of solar PV in China was boosted by privately owned enterprises (POEs), such as Suntech and Yingli, set up by experts who had returned from overseas with knowledge of modern green-energy technology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> or having expertise in manufacturing scale-up. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref> Local governments granted various forms of support to local solar businesses within their jurisdictions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> However, it was the huge export markets for solar PV, such as Spain and Germany, that stimulated the development of China's solar PV industry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> From 2004 to 2008, the manufacturing of solar cell experienced a 'wild growth' phase, increasing from 50 MW per year of production volume in 2004 to 2000 MW per year in 2008. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref> In parallel, China's share of the global PV cell market share rose from less than 1 per cent in 2004 to nearly 45 per cent in 2008. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> Industry development in this phase was enabled by a number of factors. The surge in demand for PV in Europe also spurred a rush of speculative investments by private companies to meet that demand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> Chinese companies imported turnkey production lines, raw materials, and second-hand equipment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20</ref> Solar POEs processed the imported purified polysilicon into wafers, cells, or modules for re-export. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">21</ref> This, in combination with support policies in solar PV manufacturing, the country's cheap labour <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22</ref> , and Chinese companies reaping economies of scale in the manufacturing process led China to gain a competitive advantage in PV products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23</ref> Around 95 per cent of solar PV made in China were exported to Germany and the US. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) Source: Author, based on 'Installed Solar Energy Capacity', Our World in Data, last updated on 12 December 2023, accessed on 14 June 2024 at <ref type="url" target="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/installed-solar-pv-">https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/installed-solar-pv-</ref>capacity?facet=none&amp;country=OWID_WRL -CHN -USA -OWID_EUR</p><p>During the same period, the central government began to stress the strategic importance of the solar PV industry and to develop the domestic solar market. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> Although The 11 th Five-Year Plan (2006) did not view the solar PV industry as an area for China's industry upgrading, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">26</ref> the Outline for National Middle and Long Term Scientific and Technological Development Plan (2006-2020) published by the State Council in 2006, and the Directory of High and New Technology Products (2006) issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) prioritized the R&amp;D and manufacture of high-costperformance solar PV cells, modules, power controllers and inverters, along with their application technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">27</ref> By the end of 2007, the central government had identified the solar PV industry as a 'high-tech industry' which could help China restructure its national economy and enhance its overall industrial competitiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">28</ref> This increased the central government's focus on the solar PV industry as a component to China's industrial strategy.</p><p>The emphasis on accelerating the industrial upgrading of the solar PV industry also prompted the central government to foster the domestic market for solar PV products. The scale-up of manufacturing and learning-by-doing in the fields of PV, along with deploying large-scale, grid-connected PV plants in China enabled costs to decline steadily, which in turn drove more widespread adoption of solar across China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29</ref> By requiring grid companies to take renewable electricity and setting quantitative targets for solar power deployment, the Renewable Energy Law adopted in 2006 and the Mid-to-Long Term Renewable Energy Development Plan (2007) helped improve the domestic market for solar PV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">30</ref> Given central government support and the success at penetrating overseas markets, by 2007 more than half of all major Chinese cities had established PV industrial policy priorities or targets, viewing the sector as an opportunity for both growth and employment. 31</p><p>0 50 100 150 200 250 300 2005 2010 2015 2020 Installed solar energy capacity (GW) Year China Europe US</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Domestic deployment of PV only accelerated after 2009</head><p>At the high-speed-development stage (2009-2018), the Chinese government strengthened its efforts to foster the domestic solar market and restructure the solar PV industry. These efforts were prompted by the desire to support the sector in the face of weaker international demand following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the anti-dumping investigation on China's solar panels after 2012, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">32</ref> as well as the cessation of production and even the bankruptcy of several domestic solar companies since 2011. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">33</ref> In 2010, the State Council emphasized again the importance of the solar PV industry for China's industrial upgrading, and recognized the solar PV industry for the first time as a 'strategic emerging industry' that could help China seize the commanding heights of the new round of economic and technological development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">34</ref> Later, the first five-year plan specifically addressing the solar industrythe 12 th Five-Year Development Plan for Solar Power (2012)demonstrated that the central government sought to boost solar power generation and demand for solar PV products, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35</ref> and reduce the cost of solar power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">36</ref> Policy actions included introducing the Large-scale PV Power Station Concession Bidding Programme, 37 the Golden Sun Programme, 38 and a generous feed-in-tariff for domestic PV projects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39</ref> The newly-introduced PV feed-in tariff of up to around US$ 0.17/KWh was significantly higher than the average rate for coal-fired electricity (around US$ 0.05/KWh) and was thus expected by the government to incentivize investments in solar power generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40</ref> With the decrease of solar power prices, the Notice on Matters Related to Photovoltaic Power Generation (2018) was adopted to gradually reduce subsidies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">41</ref> Subsequently in 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Notice on Actively Promoting Subsidy-Free Grid Parity for Wind Power and Solar Power Generation, marking the beginning of the era of subsidy-free grid parity for solar power generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Rapid scale-up and technology innovation have played critical roles in cost reductions and enabled Chinese dominance in solar</head><p>The development of the solar industry has led to technology upgrades and enhanced conversion efficiency of PV systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref> Both the scale-up of wafer manufacturing and the improvement of the conversion efficiency of cells have been essential for cost reductions, with manufacturing scale-up particularly critical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> As production increased, the cost of solar modules per watt of capacity fell in China from $4.25 to $0.36 between 2006 and 2017. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">45</ref> The conversion efficiency refers to the efficiency of transforming solar energy into electricity. For every 1 per cent increase in photovoltaic power conversion efficiency, the cost per kilowatt-hour decreases by 5 per cent to 7 per cent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46</ref> The conversion rate of monocrystalline silicon solar cells has increased from around 18 per cent in 2012 to around 24 per cent in 2023. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> For China, as it looks to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality goal, the main problem now is how to integrate solar power into power grids and how to best use decentralized solar power rather than how to reduce the cost of solar power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> In sum, at the outset, before being recognized as an economic sector for fostering China's industrial competitiveness, China's solar PV industry primarily flourished as an export-oriented manufacturing sector. Its success can be explained by the transfer of mature and standardized turnkey manufacturing lines, by the external demand in the European Union (EU) that acted as a catalyst for the sector's growth in China, and then by central government intervention for industry development and consistent support mechanisms implemented by local governments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Evolution of China's hydrogen policy</head><p>Whereas the solar industry started as a niche export manufacturing industry, China's consideration of hydrogen as a fuel began as early as 1986 with R&amp;D for hydrogen fuel cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49</ref> with no consideration of the carbon footprint of hydrogen. Hydrogen development was an industrial strategy. The view was that promoting hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) could help China in its new energy vehicles industrial strategy and reduce vulnerabilities related to the import of oil and gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">50</ref> However, the complexity of hydrogen value chains and unclear applications limited progress in hydrogen technology development, resulting in little enthusiasm from the Chinese government. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51</ref> In the early 2000s, Japan's progress in commercializing fuel cells and Chinese policymakers' concerns about the country's oil import dependence raised hydrogen again in the energy policy agenda, as demonstrated by the first domestically made FCV launched in 2003. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">52</ref> Also, in 2006, the National Midand-Long Term Development Plan of Science and Technology (2006-2020) saw efforts to develop other segments of the hydrogen value chain, and identified hydrogen storage and transport as an emerging energy technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">53</ref> Because of expensive hydrogen technologies, this renewed interest did not lead to sustainable investment or scalable development in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54</ref> Between 2010 and 2014, the development of FCVs fell behind the development of electric vehicles due to factors such as insufficient technology development and the high costs of hydrogen infrastructure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">55</ref> During 2015 and 2019, there was a rapid development of FCVs, along with R&amp;D for hydrogen production, storage and transport crucial for refuelling FCVs. This was likely due to China's efforts to catch up with neighbouring countries like Japan and South Korea in FCV development, in part by introducing new subsidy regimes for purchasing FCVs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56</ref> Since 2016, in the context of geoeconomic competition for clean energy supply chains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">57</ref> significant moves by the government at the central and local levels have accelerated the industrial development of all types of hydrogen and all segments of hydrogen value-chains. To seek leadership in the industry, the 13th Industrial Development Plan of Strategic Emerging Industries (2016) identified hydrogen production and storage and hydrogen refuelling stations as 'strategic emerging energy industries'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58</ref> This designation suggests that developing hydrogen would be integrated in national economic development plans and benefit from state guidance and support, as strategic industries are at the heart of China's industrial transformation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">59</ref> In light of this, policies such as Action Plans for Energy Technological Revolution and Innovation (2016-2030) have provided guidance to priority areas for promoting hydrogen technology, such as renewable hydrogen production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">60</ref> Since 2020, policy makers have focused more on upstream hydrogen. Following China's pledge, issued in 2020, to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, the hydrogen economy has received new emphasis, with renewable hydrogen and electrolyzers now a rising priority for Chinese policymakers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61</ref> In 2021, more than 30 industrial policies (for example, the 14th Five-Year Plan of Energy Technology Innovation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62</ref> issued at the central level incorporated guidance on hydrogen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">63</ref> The most important policy document so far in the hydrogen sectorthe Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022)articulated the aims of improving efficiency of renewable hydrogen production and of scaling up the productivity of related production equipment, such as electrolyzers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">64</ref> More specifically, The 14th Five-Year Plan of Energy Technology Innovation (2021) set the objectives of improving technological capacities for manufacturing PEM electrolyzers and solid oxide (SO) electrolyzers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65</ref> Local government strategies have been mixed, with some emphasizing FCVs, and others electrolysis.</p><p>Prior to the implementation of the Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022), some local governments were already promoting innovation and the electrolyzer manufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">66</ref> , even though the emphasis remained on the development of hydrogen fuel cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">67</ref> For example, Beijing and Changshu city, in Jiangsu province, are promoting the advancement of PEM and SO electrolyzer technology, while also seeking to improve the efficiency of alkaline electrolysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">68</ref> Similarly, Ningbo city in Zhejiang province announced plans to support hydrogen equipment manufacturing for both alkaline and PEM electrolysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">69</ref> Accordingly, similar to the electrolyzer markets of other states, which are dominated by PEM electrolyzers and alkaline electrolyzers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">70</ref> China is catching up in PEM electrolysis and continues to improve the performance of alkaline electrolysis (see section 5 for more detailed analysis of government support for electrolysis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Strategies for hydrogen have shifted from a niche industry towards a key contributor to industrial decarbonization</head><p>Hydrogen has been used as a chemical or a raw material in China's chemical and refinery industry for decades. As such, China is the world's largest consumer of hydrogen, mainly derived from coal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">71</ref> Since 2020, China has considered viewing hydrogen as an energy carrier in its legislation by easing the regulatory requirements associated with its categorisation as a hazardous chemical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">72</ref> Under the 2002 Regulation on the Safety Management of Hazardous Chemicals 73 , hydrogen production requires special licenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">74</ref> and projects are limited to chemical industrial parks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">75</ref> The complex procedures associated with meeting the safety requirements have stalled some renewable hydrogen projects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">76</ref> However, China's Energy Law, approved in November 2024 and in effect on 1 January 2025, should ease the regulatory burden of hydrogen production, given that it is now considered an energy carrier. However, hydrogen has not yet been removed from the Catalogue of Hazardous Chemicals (2022). <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">77</ref> How the dual status of hydrogen is dealt with in hydrogen projects remains unknown.</p><p>The importance of hydrogen as a decarbonization strategy is increasingly evident in policy documents, too. The 14th Five-Year Plan of Modern Energy System (2022) and the Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022) highlighted the importance of renewable hydrogen as part of China's goal of carbon neutrality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">78</ref> According to the Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022), 'the focus of China's hydrogen production system is the development of renewable hydrogen', with a quantitative target for producing 100,000 to 200,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year by 2025. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">79</ref> This target is really quite conservative, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">80</ref> given that China's demand for hydrogen per year is projected to be 40.58 million tons by 2025. But setting a numeric target for renewable hydrogen still sends an important signal to the market. <ref type="bibr">81</ref> The 14 th Five-Year Plan of Renewable Energy Development (2022) further specified that renewable hydrogen production should be located in regions where renewable electricity prices are low and where there have been demonstration projects for hydrogen storage, transport and use (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). 82 Source: Author, based on hydrogen-related policies adopted at the central level •The promotion of renewable hydrogen production and the manufacture of relevant equipment The Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022) •The production of renewable hydrogen in places with cheap electricity prices •The integrated development of renewable hydrogen production and its transportation, storage, and use The 14 th Five-Year Plan of Renewable Energy Development (2022) •The pursuit of technology innovation for PEM electrolysers and SO electrolysers The 14th Five-Year Plan of Energy Technology Innovation (2021) Source: Author; Based on a research report; 83 The map of China is retrieved from 'Discover the 23 Provinces of China', ThoughtCo., 7 June 2024, accessed on 19 June 2024 at <ref type="url" target="https://www.thoughtco.com/china-provinces-4158617">https://www.thoughtco.com/china-provinces- 4158617</ref> Note: The data is last updated on 31 December 2023.

If deployment fails to gather momentum and export options are limited, companies may reduce production.</p><p>The technological development of China's PEM electrolyzers still lags behind leading economies such as the EU. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">98</ref> For the key components for PEM electrolyzers, China still relies on imports of proton exchange membranes and precious-metal catalysts, whereas alkaline electrolyzers use domestically sourced materials and equipment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">99</ref> Furthermore, new policy measures and protectionist policies banning technology transfer and international trade for high-tech equipment 100 could limit the development of PEM electrolyzers in China. Still, the Chinese government is seeking to promote R&amp;D and demonstration projects for PEM electrolyzers, despite concerns about import dependence, suggesting that for now it is prioritizing electrolyzer development over technology independence.</p><p>Also, the central government has since 2019 sought to attract foreign companies to manufacture hydrogen-related equipment in China, as part of its efforts to foster a domestic hydrogen manufacturing industry. The Directory of Encouraging Foreign Investments issued that year includes hydrogen equipment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">101</ref> has enabled partnerships such as that between Sinopec and Cummins, a U.S. company, for the manufacture of PEM electrolyzers at the end of 2021. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">102</ref> Starting from 2022, The Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022) began to stress hydrogen cooperation as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including cooperation on hydrogen technology and equipment, and the formulation of standards for FCVs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">103</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Comparing China's hydrogen and solar development trajectories</head><p>Despite the long history of hydrogen development in China, its official recognition as a strategic emerging industry in 2016 marks a turning point and coincides with the inception of the domestic electrolysis industry. Since then, the development of renewable hydrogen in China has been driven by the central government's ambition for industrial upgrading, by cheap renewable electricity prices, by the urgency of the energy transition, and by local governments' ambition to take leading positions in developing the domestic industry. Both SOEs and POEs are playing important roles at this early stage of development with the Chinese government now also seeking international cooperation in hydrogen. So, even though both solar PV and hydrogen have benefitted from government support, it is important to unpack the drivers and nature of these support mechanisms.</p><p>In the early stages of solar PV and electrolyzersdefined as 1997 to 2004 for solar and 2016 to the present for electrolyzersboth sectors benefitted from supportive policies for manufacturing at the local level and broader development of industry. In addition, both sectors benefit from China's natural resource endowment (namely, primary industrial silicon for solar PV and renewable energy for electrolyzers). But there are also notable differences:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">PV was initially a niche export industry, whereas hydrogen is part of a domestic decarbonization strategy.</head><p>The solar PV sector was designated as a strategic emerging industry during the third stage of its development, roughly from 2009 to 2018, and relatively late on in its development. This designation matters because a 'strategic emerging industry' is considered central to China's industrial upgrading and its core competitiveness and as such, receives significant state support. Even though the concept of 'strategic emerging industry' was first articulated in The Decision on Accelerating the Foster and Development of Strategic Emerging Industries (2010), <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">104</ref> support for such 'high-tech industries' had already started in the 1990s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">105</ref> But it was only in 2007, in light of the increasing maturity of the solar PV industry, growing attention to global demand for clean energy, and the economic strategy of developing domestic markets in all economic sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">106</ref> that it was deemed critical to China's economic development and then incorporated in the 'strategic emerging industries'.</p><p>In contrast, renewable hydrogen production was classified a strategic emerging industry by the central government in 2016, during its early stages. China's electrolyzer manufacturers are perceived to be part of the national effort to develop green industries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">107</ref> This implies that funding will be allocated to the R&amp;D of hydrogen technologies, that supportive policies will be adopted to incentivize investments, and that international cooperation is welcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">108</ref> Moreover, The Energy Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC) states that the Government will actively develop hydrogen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">109</ref> This provision lays a legal foundation for China's development of hydrogen and has significantly boosted domestic confidence in the hydrogen business. The commercial landscape for renewable hydrogen in China is complex. SOEs are leading investors in renewable hydrogen production but POEs are playing a crucial role in cost reductions for electrolyzers.</p><p>The different commercial landscape is likely related to the technological characteristics of solar PV and hydrogen and to the nature of China's energy economy. While POEs have been crucial players in manufacturingwith contributions from foreign investors -SOEs dominate China's energy sector and are critical in developing strategically-important, large-scale energy infrastructure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">111</ref> From 1997 to 2004, solar PV developed as a manufacturing industry and did not require the construction of largescale infrastructure, providing opportunities for POEs and foreign companies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">112</ref> By contrast, the complex systems and products associated with renewable hydrogen production, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">113</ref> not to mention complex hydrogen value chains, necessitate the involvement of various stakeholders with different capacities. SOEs rely on their existing infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">114</ref> and are better equipped to deal with the bureaucratic approval procedures required for hydrogen projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">115</ref> , especially if these cut across provincial borders. POEs, however, are important for electrolyzer development given their experience in manufacturing energy-related equipment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Hydrogen production is located near low-cost energy inputs, rather than industrial clusters aimed at exports.</head><p>In the initial phases, most renewable hydrogen projects are located in North China where renewable electricity prices are low, because electricity costs are a significant component of the overall cost of renewable hydrogen production. Similarly, the solar PV industry was first developed in locations where local governments were highly supportive, offering tax incentives and low electricity prices for manufacturing, and close to abundant resources of primary industrial silicon.</p><p>In sum, while both solar PV and renewable hydrogen projects benefitted in the early stages from local government support and being developed in proximity to key inputs, there are inherent differences in their development trajectories: solar started as a niche manufacturing industry for export markets, dominated by private firms which received government recognition and support as a strategic industry only at later stages of development. This also coincided with growing emphasis on decarbonization. Hydrogen, meanwhile, started as a strategic industry aimed at supporting China's decarbonization goals. And while private firms are active in electrolyzer manufacturing, SOEs play a significant role in hydrogen deployment and development given the need for large infrastructure investments, which are harder for private actors to undertake.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Instruments for the Early Development of Solar PV</head><p>The priority at the early stage was the manufacture of solar PV hardware (as detailed in section 0), rather than solar PV project installation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">118</ref> In 1982, MOST began funding R&amp;D for renewable energy technology and related equipment, including solar PV systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">119</ref> Since 2000, National Plans for the R&amp;D of High Technology have made more funding available for the development of solar cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">120</ref> including for example up to Yuan 100 million ($13.6 million as of January 2025) available to small and medium companies for their basic research in the solar PV sector. 121 However, this amount was relatively small compared with the over Yuan 10 billion allocated to wind power development between 1996 and 2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">122</ref> Furthermore, no funding was specifically allocated for solar PV development. But considerable government support was directed at technology transfers and localisation: imported PV equipment was exempted from customs duties according to the 1997 Notice on adjusting the tax policy on Imported Equipment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">123</ref> The Directory of High and New Technology Products Encouraging Foreign Investments (2003) also encouraged foreign investors to invest in the manufacture of solar PV systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">124</ref> That said, the solar industry benefited from general financial support for renewable energy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">125</ref> but the central government did not issue sector-specific development plans or introduce specific incentives for promoting investment in the solar PV industry and solar energy production <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">126</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). This was also the case at the local level. Local government supported solar PV development as part of policy calls to develop high-tech industries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">127</ref> by leveraging various high-tech support schemes set up by Beijing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">128</ref> Before the massive growth of the solar PV industry in 2007, only a few pioneering local governments had allocated funds for basic solar PV research to be carried out by POEs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">129</ref> They helped these companies reduce production costs by refunding land transfer fees, exempting corporate income tax, and granting cheap electricity prices. For example, as early as 2004, the provincial government of Jiangsu was considering developing a local solar PV market. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">130</ref> The Opinions on Using Price Leverage for Sustainable Development adopted in Jiangsu in 2005 aimed to incentivize investments in solar power generation by offering solar power higher prices and exempting it from electricity market competition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">131</ref> During the same period, Wuxi city's municipal government was exploring support for high-technology industries such as solar PV through government-led funds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">132</ref> Additionally, with the approval of the State Council, those local governments were able to waive import duties on highly-purified silicon which was not widely available in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">133</ref> For instance, in 2009 the Jiangsu provincial government introduced an exemption on import duties for materials or equipment that were in short supply domestically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">134</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Instruments for the Early Development of Renewable Hydrogen</head><p>Both the central government and local governments have adopted various instruments to support the development of renewable hydrogen and electrolysers, though local governments are more ambitious. 135</p></div>

At the local level, some local governments (for instance, the provincial government of Shanxi and the municipal government of Chengdu) have established industrial funds which blend public finance and private finance to support R&amp;D for hydrogen value chains in general. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">140</ref> At the same time, the policy focus extends beyond manufacturing as the Mid-and Long-Term Hydrogen Industrial Development Plan (2022), which looks to promote renewable hydrogen investments with electrolyzer applications, has pledged support for hydrogen development through bank loans and industrial funds, although it does not explicitly support renewable hydrogen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">141</ref> The Green and Low-Carbon Transition Industry Guidance (2024) stressed that projects for renewable hydrogen production or for the manufacturing of relevant equipment would be eligible for support via preferential loans, subsidies, and simplified administrative procedures. This guidance also however does not provide specific details. 142</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Local Government Support</head><p>The vaguely framed support at the central level contrasts with local government activity. Local government entities have actively attracted hydrogen investments through cash grants and the creation of industrial parks. The local finance administrations of Chengdu, Ningxia, and Jiaxing have incentivized competitive hydrogen companies with cash grants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">143</ref> For instance, Jiaxing municipal government granted cash grants to the establishment of Meijin Guohong (Zhejiang) Hydrogen Technology Co., Ltd. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">144</ref> The cash grant varies according to the amount of the invested capital. Other local governments, for instance Tianjin municipal government and the Autonomous Region of Ningxia, have also established industrial parks to boost their manufacturing capacities for renewable hydrogen value chains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">145</ref> Hydrogen companies then establish new subsidiaries or projects in these industrial parks as local governments offer preferential treatment for land use and streamlined administrative processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">146</ref> The 'Renewable Hydrogen Production Base' in Zhangjiakou, Hebei, serves as a prime example, where a comprehensive renewable hydrogen value chain -encompassing production, transportation, deployment, and associated manufacturing -is being developed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">147</ref> Local governments also offer lower electricity rates to promote renewable hydrogen production and the use of electrolyzers. In Foshan, the off-peak electricity rate to produce hydrogen has been set at 0.26 yuan/kWh since 2017. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">148</ref> Between 2020 and 2023, the incremental electricity consumption of hydrogen producers in Chengdu was subject to a unified transmission and distribution price of 0.105 yuan/kWh. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">149</ref> Meanwhile, since 2019, hydrogen production from water electrolysis in Zhangjiakou has also been subject to electricity rates of no more than 0.36 yuan/kWh. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">150</ref> But for renewable hydrogen to compete with fossil-fuel-based hydrogen, renewable electricity prices need to fall below 0.15 yuan/kWh (as discussed in section 3). Therefore, only renewable hydrogen produced in Chengdu is currently competitive with fossil-fuel-based hydrogen.</p><p>Prior to late 2024, local governments also supported hydrogen development by lifting regulatory barriers: hydrogen was classified as hazardous chemical which constrains its use (as discussed in section 2). The central government allowed local governments to set up some renewable hydrogen projects outside the chemical industrial parks and/or to cancel the requirements for applying for safety production licenses (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">151</ref> In November 2024, China approved its long-awaited Energy Law which changed the classification of hydrogen and will now ease this regulatory burden but, as discussed above, hydrogen is still listed in the Catalogue for Hazardous Chemicals 2022. Support from local governments to ease these regulatory constraints therefore remains key.</p><p>In a similar vein, local governments are subsidising hydrogen use. The pilot city regime for fuel cell vehicles 152 sets a carbon emission standard for hydrogen of less than 15 kg CO2 for every 1 kg of hydrogen 153 with no distinction between fossil-fuel based hydrogen and renewable hydrogen. The China Hydrogen Alliance, an industry alliance consisting of SOEs and Universities, has proposed the emission standard for renewable hydrogen at 4.9 kg CO2 per kg of hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">154</ref> . This standard has not been adopted in any central or local policy documents. While the nationally-set requirement is less stringent, the CHA standard is a nod toward the use of hydrogen with low CO2 emissions. At the local level, since 2023, the government of Ningxia subsidizes the use of renewable hydrogen (5.6 yuan/kg) up to 3 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">155</ref> As a result, in 2023, the price of renewable hydrogen in China was around 25 yuan/kg for electricity costs of 0.4 yuan/kWh, or 15 yuan/kg in the case of electricity at 0.2 yuan/kWh. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">156</ref> Although these subsidies do not disclose the CO2 level for renewable hydrogen, these subsidies effectively reduce one-fifth to one-third of the cost for renewable hydrogen use. This illustrates the crucial role of electricity prices as a cost input for renewable hydrogen, as compared with solar PV, where cell and model prices form the main cost input in electricity produced.</p><p>Table 4: Local experimentation for promoting renewable hydrogen production Provinces/Cities Issuing dates Local governments' efforts to relax the regulatory requirements governing hazardous chemicals Wuhan 2022</p><p>Projects for hydrogen production are allowed to be operated outside chemical industrial parks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">157</ref> Shandong province 2022 Projects for renewable hydrogen production are allowed to be operated outside chemical industrial parks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">158</ref> The district of Dadong in Shenyang</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Comparison of Policy Instruments</head><p>In some respects, policy support for electrolysis and hydrogen is greater than that for solar. Clear and consistent support mechanisms have in the past accelerated the production and deployment of clean energy technology by scaling up manufacturing and promoting R&amp;D, <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">161</ref> thus impacting exports and potentially enabling a leadership role in global industrial supply chains. As part of this, designation of hydrogen as a strategic emerging industry results in generous state support. Interestingly, though, until the early 2000s, the central government focused more on wind energy development, compared with solar PV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">162</ref> Ironically perhaps, the solar PV industry was developed by a few companies receiving provincial support with clear commercial incentives overseas, rather than due to national-level schemes.</p><p>By contrast, the development of renewable hydrogen and electrolyzers currently seems more reliant on a favourable institutional setting at both the central and local level. The official recognition that hydrogen production and the manufacturing of relevant equipment are crucial for China's industrial upgrading <ref type="bibr">163</ref> and the need for China to catch up with global hydrogen technology development 164 are likely to maintain support for industrial development even in the absence of a clear commercial incentive. Based on government signals, Chinese manufacturers can seek to develop and mature electrolyzer technologies for the domestic market even as electrolyzer exports remain minimal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">165</ref> That said, fierce competition in the domestic electrolyzer market, demand from foreign hydrogen markets such as the EU, and corporate strategies for internationalization will still provide an impetus for electrolyzer exports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">166</ref> However, the specific instruments adopted in the electrolyzer sector are different. Unlike the early advancement of the manufacturing capacities for solar PV, the central government does not exempt custom duties for importing key equipment or raw materials for PEM electrolysers. While the government is still experimenting with hydrogen regulations and support mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">167</ref> and could still introduce tax breaks for imports, for now it may still intend to develop renewable hydrogen-related technological capabilities through domestic innovation (see section 3). Moreover, the extent to which tax breaks will be successful in attracting foreign companies is an open question. Foreign companies are now more cautious than in the early 2000s about technology investments in China. They have stressed the need for 'protecting their intellectual property and market status' <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">168</ref> as foreign investments in Mainland China have fallen due to a combination of concerns about over-dependence on Chinese high tech goods and IP transfers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">169</ref> Despite this, the Chinese government has continued adopting regulations (say, the Directories on Encouraged Foreign Investments issued by NDRC) to promote foreign investments, to rebuild foreign investors' confidence and to ensure the inflow of advanced know-how and technology. 170</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Cost Reductions and Technological characteristics</head><p>Multiple factors influence the future cost-reduction path of renewable hydrogen. These include technology learning rates (learning-by-doing), ever-changing input costs, and the availability of the required raw materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">171</ref> In the learning-by-doing process, when manufacturers accumulate experience and innovate in a repeated manufacturing process over time, a domestic industry can reduce costs while scaling up output capacity. Studies on learning rates have examined cost declines for clean energy technologies over time when cumulative production doubles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">172</ref> Usually, the learning rates are high at the early stages, then level off and may stagnate or even decline because doubling production requires more time at later stages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">173</ref> This suggests that new technologies can experience a sharp cost decline before becoming mature, but the rate of later reductions may slow down or cease. Put simply, cost reductions are usually not linear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">174</ref> The higher learning rates are, the steeper the cost reductions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">175</ref> Technologies with relatively higher learning rates are more likely to experience rapid cost declines necessary to achieve commercial scale and widespread deployment, potentially displacing incumbent technologies, compared with technologies with relatively lower learning rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">176</ref> Technological characteristics can impact the learning-by-doing process, ultimately influencing the costreduction trend for clean energy technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">177</ref> Based on innovation processes, clean energy technologies are usually categorized into manufacturing-intensive technologies, design-intensive technologies, and technologies with complex products and systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">178</ref> The development of the manufacturing-intensive technologies requires continuous learning through large-scale manufacturing and innovation in production equipment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">179</ref> but innovation in these technologies is rapid because they are typically standardized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">180</ref> In contrast, the learning and innovation of the deployment of designintensive technologies depends on the operation of energy technologies. <ref type="bibr">181</ref> Because they tend to involve complex systems and different product-architecture, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">182</ref> the feedback from the application of components, sub-systems, and systems helps stimulate learning and innovation in the design of these areas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">183</ref> Yet, learning and innovation in design-intensive technologies and in technologies with complex products and systems can vary by application, making the process more complicated.</p><p>As such, learning rates of manufacturing-intensive technologies are usually high and continuous manufacturing experimentation enables rapid cost declines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">184</ref> Moreover, strong market competition accelerates cost reductions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">185</ref> Conversely, learning rates for design-intensive technologies and technologies with complex products and systems tend to be lower. 186</p></div>

First, even after reaching the projected rate, China achieved substantial and unexpected cost reductions in solar PV that were related to both process-innovation and fierce domestic competition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">207</ref> In terms of alkaline electrolyzers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">208</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> demonstrates that when both electrolysis systems approach their potential efficiency and cost limits, learning rates and cost reductions tend to slow down.

Source: Author, based on scholars' academic estimation 209 Note: This figure is not precise, only for an indication of the decreasing trend of learning rates</p><p>The OECD also notes that 'cost reductions [of electrolyzers] are expected to be largest during the early phase of demonstration which is starting now'. <ref type="bibr">210</ref> As such, continuous large-scale manufacturing may contribute less to the cost reduction of electrolyzers as they mature. Significantly, because electrolyzers are technologies with complex systems and products, further cost reductions may depend on the adaptation to different applications and require corresponding innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">211</ref> It cannot be ruled out that China will achieve greater-than-expected cost reductions over time given its history of industrial overcapacity and support for domestic deployment. But these cost reductions can likely be realized within the country, and may not be as straightforward to export and replicate internationally.</p><p>It is also important to note that price trends are likely to differ for alkaline and PEM electrolysers. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows that since 2021, the price of China-made alkaline electrolyzers has been lower than the average overseas price. Moreover, the cost declines over 2021-2022 have been more rapid in China than those made abroad. This is likely due to the intense competition between China's alkaline electrolyzer manufacturers, 212 the country's relatively low labour costs, and the mature manufacturing innovation system where electrolyser manufacturers have the advantage of procuring domestically-sourced materials and components at significantly reduced costs compared with their Western counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">213</ref> Cost declines have since stabilized between 2022 and 2024 (with 2024 data based on estimates). Meanwhile, the cost of alkaline electrolysers manufactured abroad is forecasted to fall more rapidly than in China between 2024 and 2030. In 2030, the price of alkaline electrolyzers in China is estimated to align with average overseas prices. This is likely related to the growing number of global manufacturers, especially as the EU and the US implement industrial policies to bolster electrolyzer manufacturing. Production in Europe and the US can save costs by designing and establishing automated manufacturing lines, in contrast to the handmade production of most electrolyzers in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">214</ref> The cost savings from automated manufacturing are expected to outweigh China's relatively low labour costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">215</ref> Although the first automated production line developed by Shanghai Hydrogen Technology Co. Ltd. for alkaline electrolyzers was established in September 2023, automated production lines may not be rolled out nationally before 2030. <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">216</ref> China is experiencing a transition from labour and equipment to halfautomated manufacturing in the alkaline electrolyzer development. Source: Author's own, based on reports produced by consultancy or securities companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">218</ref> PEM electrolyzers demonstrate a different pathway. As seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, since 2021, the cost of Chinese PEM electrolyzers has been higher on average than abroad, mainly because of high import prices for PEM electrolyzer components. <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">219</ref> Prices in China and abroad are forecasted to undergo a sharp reduction between 2025 and 2030 for the first time, unlike alkaline electrolyzers that may have already seen the largest cost declines. This difference between the two types of electrolyzers aligns with their respective learning rates (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). This could be attributed to a slower pace in cost reduction due to the relatively lower learning rate for PEM electrolyzers.</p><p>Furthermore, after 2025, the price of PEM electrolyzers in China appears it should become increasingly in line with the average overseas price. To date, PEM electrolyzers in China have primarily been used in demonstration projects and are still at the pre-commercialization stage, unlike alkaline electrolysis which is already commercial. This, combined with the need for imported inputs suggests that the cost of PEM electrolyzers in China will struggle to fall below the average overseas price in 2030. That said, there are scenarios in which costs in China fall more rapidly than expected. Such cost declines would require growing efforts to use domestically sourced materials in the upstream and to scale up manufacturing; support for the large-scale application of PEM electrolyzers in coupling with variable renewable power which is crucial for reducing renewable curtailment in China; and more aggressive Government objectives for developing PEM electrolysers (see Section 3).  Source: Author's own, based on reports produced by consultancy or securities companies 221 6.3 PV achieved fast cost reductions through massive manufacturing, while cost reductions in electrolysers are more complex.</p><p>Considering this, China's mature manufacturing-intensive innovation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">222</ref> competitive in rapidly scaling up manufacturing for cost declinesmay not help electrolyzer manufacturers achieve much of a cost advantage in the future global electrolyzer market. Indeed, China's ecosystem equips electrolyzer manufacturers to fully use domestic industrial capacities for large-scale manufacturing, compared with the early manufacturing of solar PV. It has enabled significant cost reductions for alkaline electrolyzers and allowed the country to keep pace with the global trend of reducing costs for PEM electrolyzers.</p><p>However, China's manufacturing still lags behind in areas such as automated production lines. Moreover, electrolyzers consist of systems and components, and their cost reduction is influenced not only by innovations in the manufacturing process but also by factors such as the performance of those systems and elements and their design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">223</ref> Even with large and rapid manufacturing in China, capitalizing on lower manufacturing costs, low electricity prices, and the potential for deployment, the extent to which Chinese electrolysis can be equally competitive abroad is another open question. In addition, the international context in which Chinese companies operate is vastly different.</p></div>

Even though there is broad policy support under the 'Going Out' policy and other policies on exporting energy-related products, there are currently no tax rebates for electrolyzer exports. Moreover, the global market is currently oversupplied meaning that protectionist policies could limit Chinese exports, at least to economies that have been early adopters of industrial policies aimed at promoting renewable hydrogen.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>The Chinese government's support for its renewable hydrogen industry and progress to date in lowering electrolyzer costs in China have led to hopes and concerns in the West. The hope is that Chinese companies' leadership in electrolyzer manufacturing will contribute to accelerating the clean energy transition worldwide. The challenge, however, is that competitors based in Europe and the US could lose market share, like they did when China scaled up the production of solar PV and came to dominate global markets.</p><p>But before assuming that China will achieve similar cost reductions in electrolysis, the comparison needs to be unpacked and questioned. The scale up and cost declines in solar PV in China, at its initial stages, were achieved through a combination of private sector innovation in a manufacturing-intensive technology, local government support, and an enabling external environment. Indeed, solar PV began as an export-oriented industry, which, when faced with trade defence measures globally, expanded with central government support to become a domestic-market serving industry. Given the size of production and in light of domestic overcapacitycosts decreased rapidly, allowing exports to remain high even as a number of manufacturers went bankrupt. Unlike many common perceptions, the solar industry gained recognition as a 'strategic emerging industry' only later on in its development.</p><p>Meanwhile, even though hydrogen development in China started as far back as the mid-1980s, it has yielded limited results, largely related to the policy focus on FCVs. This changed markedly in 2016 when Beijing recognised renewable hydrogen and electrolyzer manufacturing as strategic emerging industries. There is now considerable government support for electrolysis manufacturing in China which has enabled significant cost reductions for alkaline electrolyzers and made it possible for Chinese manufacturers to catch up in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.</p><p>But as this paper argues, PEM electrolyzers are less likely to achieve the same significant cost declines and global market share as solar PV did for a number of reasons. First, the complexity of electrolysis systems can make it harder to achieve similar cost reductions to solar PV because it limits learning rates and potential cost declines. The components in electrolysis systems each have their own distinct learning rates and cost declines, making the overall assessment of cost declines more complicated.</p><p>Government support can help manufacturers to mitigate risks at the early stage of R&amp;D and expand manufacturing. It has also enabled the creation of a manufacturing innovation system that enables Chinese companies to evolve from technology catch-up to taking leading positions in some clean energy technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">275</ref> China's solar PV prices fell to global levels in 2007 and then continued to decline through 2023, extending and exceeding expected cost declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">276</ref> in large part due to standardized equipment and economies of scale from mass production, but also due to efficiency enhancements and innovations in the manufacturing process. But as argued here, electrolysis is not just a manufacturingintensive sector.</p><p>In addition, unlike in solar PV, the cost reductions in electrolyzers are only one factor in the final price of renewable hydrogen, which also depends on the cost of renewable electricity inputs. This implies that rapid cost reductions in electrolyzers may not be sufficient to bring renewable hydrogen to a price level enabling parity with fossil-fuel-based hydrogen or other energy sources, at least within the next decade.</p><p>Other factors distinguish the path of China's PV sector from the future path of China's hydrogen industry. China's solar PV sector benefitted from open markets, investments, and foreign technology transfers. Chinese manufacturers imported turnkey production lines and relatively standardized equipment and subsequently innovated the manufacturing process. But innovation in electrolysis systems requires feedback from application and deployment, in addition to learning in the manufacturing process.</p><p>The shifting international landscape also presents challenges for technology transfers as well as for electrolyzer exports. At the early stage of solar PV development, global trade was more open to China, and European policies to promote renewables meant demand for PV exceeded supplies. Now, the energy transition has been recognized as a crucial strategy, but it has also become more politicized and securitized, intertwining with domestic industrial policies to ensure local competitiveness. While China's ambition for developing renewable hydrogen and electrolyzers provides business opportunities for foreign energy companies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">277</ref> the securitization of existing economic relations can prevent foreign companies from investing in China's hydrogen sector or may extend protectionist measures on Chinese electrolyzers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">278</ref> The securitization of China's engagement in global clean energy supply chains may increase the costs of adopting clean energy technologies and thus lead to cost inefficiencies of the global energy transition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">279</ref> Furthermore, the global overcapacity for electrolyzers, possibly due to the slow deployment of planned renewable hydrogen investments hydrogen, <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">280</ref> is an additional barrier to China's electrolyzer exports.</p><p>In sum, there exist major differences in the future path of renewable hydrogen in China as compared with the past trajectory of solar PV. Technology complexity, China's relative weakness in PEM electrolyzers, and the domestic focus of the country's renewable hydrogen strategy all differentiate this market from that of solar PV in past decades. While rapid cost reductions are possible, this appears unlikely to lead to the type of market dominance achieved by China in the solar PV space.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Installed solar energy capacity in China, Europe, and the United States (GW) ......................
